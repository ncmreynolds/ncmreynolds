It's all kind of sparse in here right now, I'm slowly documenting existing work stored elsewhere so it is fit for public consumption.

Most of the things I build are interactive props and devices for use in Live Action Roleplaying games (LARP).

My projects are closer to escape room props than something you'd see in a theatre or movie production. They need to perform in a wide range of circumstances in an unscripted fashion and look like they 'work', but people using them are also willing to use their imagination and accept the limitations of 'real life'.
