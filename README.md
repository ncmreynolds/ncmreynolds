# About Nick's work

It's all kind of sparse in here right now, but I'm slowly documenting existing work stored elsewhere so it's fit for public consumption.

Everything I write is about creating interactive props and devices for use in Live Action Roleplaying games (LARP). This makes them closer to theatre props than consumer items but they need to perform in a wider range of circumstances in an unscripted fashion.
